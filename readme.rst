Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but it is strongly advised to NOT run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.


**************************
Installation or Deployment
**************************

The SQL file inside the tool folder has to be imported to phpmyadmin. Before uploading the files to the server, the “htaccess” file has to be edited to remove or edit the folder name based on the server requirement. Furthermore, the new URL has to be added inside the config.php file inside the config folder. To log in as the admin, the following login credentials can be used.
User email: admin@gmail.com
Password: $Testpass1$
